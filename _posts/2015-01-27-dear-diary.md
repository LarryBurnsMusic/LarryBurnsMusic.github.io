What is it with that Mary girl?  Dragging me to school every day. As if I had a choice.  What you don't hear in those nursery rhymes is that she starves me if I don't go to school with her; it's the only way I can stay alive!  I'm thinking about being adopted by Little Bo Peep, sure I may get lost, but anything is better than being with Mary and those little brats at school (shudder, shudder).
